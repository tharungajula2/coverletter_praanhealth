# Why I Want to Build with Praan Health
### A Personal Thinking Artifact

This project is a dedicated landing page serving as a "living cover letter" for Praan Health. Instead of a static PDF, it demonstrates product thinking, systems design, and craftsmanship through code.

It is designed to be read like a personal letter: calm, focused, and respectful of the reader's time.

## 📖 Content Overview

The narrative is structured into 6 key chapters, moving from personal alignment to operational execution:

1.  **Where I Fit**: Defining the intersection of Product, Academy, Quality, and Systems.
2.  **Operating Principles**: "Auditability over Cleverness" and "Quality Must Be Designed."
3.  **Builder Mindset**: How I translate intent into working scorecards, workflows, and operating systems.
4.  **The Quality Engine**: Creating a reinforcement loop between Product and Academy.
5.  **Early Contribution**: A 60-day plan focusing on "Observe" and "Build."
6.  **Personal Alignment**: Why healthcare and long-arc systems matter to me.

## 🎨 Design System

The visual language is intentional—avoiding "SaaS marketing" tropes in favor of an **editorial, museum-like quality**.

*   **Atmosphere**: A "Museum Light" gradient system (Cool Slate & Warm Stone) at 40-50% opacity creates a tangible, premium texture.
*   **Surface Physics**: High-contrast matte cards (`bg-white/80` on `slate-50`) with translucent borders (`border-slate-200/80`) and ambient occlusion shadows.
*   **Typography**: A restrained scale using `Inter` (sans-serif), prioritizing readability and hierarchy over size.
*   **Interaction**: Subtle, weighty interactions. No flashiness, just stability.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Framework**: [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
*   **Animation**: `tailwindcss-animate` for subtle entrance fades.
