# Praan Health: Digital Cover Letter & Builders Lab

**A "Product-Minded Generalist" Pitch by Tharun Kumar Gajula.**

## 1. What is this Project?
This is not just a standard web page. It is a live demonstration of skill. 
Instead of sending a PDF cover letter, I built a fully functional web application to demonstrate that I don't just "manage" products—I **build** them.

This application serves two purposes:
1.  **The Pitch:** It tells my professional story, optimizing for the "Founder's Office" role at Praan Health.
2.  **The Proof:** It allows you to use a working **Clinical Assessment Engine** (The "Builders Lab") to screen a patient in real-time.

## 2. Key Feature: The "Clinical Assessment Engine"
Located in Section 4 ("The Proof"), this is a custom-built software tool designed to simulate a patient intake process.

### How it Works (The Logic):
1.  **Input:** The user answers **15 Clinical Questions** (Age, Diabetes, Heart, Falls, etc.).
2.  **Processing:** The "Brain" of the app assigns specific **Risk Scores** (0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 points) to every answer.
3.  **Output:** It instantly calculates a specific health profile across **10 Body Systems** (Metabolic, Cardio, Neuro, Frailty, etc.) and visualizes it in a dashboard.

### Why I built it:
To prove that I have the **Clinical Depth** to understand medical protocols and the **Technical Range** to turn them into working software.

## 3. Technology Stack (Under the Hood)
For the technically curious, here is what powers this application:

*   **Framework:** [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (The industry standard for React apps).
*   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (JavaScript with strict safety rules).
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (For rapid, mobile-first design).
*   **Deployment:** Ready for Vercel/Netlify.
